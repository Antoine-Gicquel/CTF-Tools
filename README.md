# CTF-Tools

This repo is made up of tools to help you automate your workflow in CTF (and to make sure you did not forget to check anything).
These tools are made to be easy to use, no complicated options !

Currently it is split into 3 parts :
* CryptoPython : contains CryptoCTF, python library containing everything you need for solving crypto challenges (RSA, AES, statistical analysis)
* SteganoPython : contains a script that will run a number of checks on the file you provide (basically Aperisolve evolved)
* WebPython : contains a script that will run a number of checks on the URL you provide (checks for robots.txt, sitemap.xml, .git, and starts dirbuster)
